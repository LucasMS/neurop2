# Microbiome analysis from "Basic skin therapy effects on grass pollen challenged patients with atopic dermatitis" project

Raw 16S rRNA gene amplicon reads (ENA study: PRJEB42333) were processed with [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html). Scripts for amplicon variant sequences (ASV) and beta diversity analysis are provided in **./analysis** folder. A text file containing the R session information for each analysis is also provided. This analysis was used in the publication by [Heratizadeh et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.17966)
